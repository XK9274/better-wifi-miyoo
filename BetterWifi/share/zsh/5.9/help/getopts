getopts optstring name [ arg ... ]
       Checks the args for legal options.  If the args are omitted, use
       the positional parameters.  A valid option argument begins  with
       a  `+' or a `-'.  An argument not beginning with a `+' or a `-',
       or the argument `--', ends the options.  Note that a single  `-'
       is  not  considered a valid option argument.  optstring contains
       the letters that getopts recognizes.  If a letter is followed by
       a  `:',  that  option  requires an argument.  The options can be
       separated from the argument by blanks.

       Each time it is invoked, getopts places  the  option  letter  it
       finds in the shell parameter name, prepended with a `+' when arg
       begins with a `+'.  The index of  the  next  arg  is  stored  in
       OPTIND.  The option argument, if any, is stored in OPTARG.

       The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly as-
       signing to OPTIND.  OPTIND has an initial value  of  1,  and  is
       normally  set  to  1 upon entry to a shell function and restored
       upon exit.  (The POSIX_BUILTINS option disables this,  and  also
       changes  the way the value is calculated to match other shells.)
       OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the  most  recent
       call  to  getopts.   If either of OPTIND or OPTARG is explicitly
       unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not
       stored.  The option itself is still stored in name in this case.

       A leading `:' in optstring causes getopts to store the letter of
       any invalid option in OPTARG, and to set name to `?' for an  un-
       known  option  and  to  `:' when a required argument is missing.
       Otherwise, getopts sets name to `?' and prints an error  message
       when  an  option  is  invalid.   The exit status is nonzero when
       there are no more options.
