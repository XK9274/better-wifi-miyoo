exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] [ command [ arg ... ] ]
       Replace the current shell with command rather than forking.   If
       command  is  a  shell  builtin  command or a shell function, the
       shell executes it, and exits when the command is complete.

       With -c clear the environment; with -l prepend - to the  argv[0]
       string of the command executed (to simulate a login shell); with
       -a argv0 set the argv[0] string of the  command  executed.   See
       the section `Precommand Modifiers' in zshmisc(1).

       If  the  option  POSIX_BUILTINS  is set, command is never inter-
       preted as a shell builtin command or shell function.  This means
       further precommand modifiers such as builtin and noglob are also
       not interpreted within the shell.  Hence command is always found
       by searching the command path.

       If  command  is omitted but any redirections are specified, then
       the redirections will take effect in the current shell.
