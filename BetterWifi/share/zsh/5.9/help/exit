exit [ n ]
       Exit the shell with the exit status specified by  an  arithmetic
       expression n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the
       last command executed.  An EOF condition  will  also  cause  the
       shell to exit, unless the IGNORE_EOF option is set.

       See  notes at the end of the section JOBS in zshmisc(1) for some
       possibly unexpected interactions of the exit command with jobs.

bye    Same as exit.

logout [ n ]
       Same as exit, except that it only works in a login shell.
