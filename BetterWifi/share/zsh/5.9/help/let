let arg ...
       Evaluate  each arg as an arithmetic expression.  See the section
       `Arithmetic Evaluation'  in  zshmisc(1)  for  a  description  of
       arithmetic  expressions.   The  exit status is 0 if the value of
       the last expression is nonzero, 1 if it is zero, and 2 if an er-
       ror occurred.
