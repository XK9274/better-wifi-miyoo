disown [ job ... ]
job ... &|
job ... &!
       Remove the specified jobs from the job table; the shell will  no
       longer  report their status, and will not complain if you try to
       exit an interactive shell with them running or stopped.   If  no
       job is specified, disown the current job.

       If  the  jobs are currently stopped and the AUTO_CONTINUE option
       is not set, a warning is printed  containing  information  about
       how  to make them running after they have been disowned.  If one
       of the latter two forms is used, the jobs will automatically  be
       made  running,  independent  of the setting of the AUTO_CONTINUE
       option.
