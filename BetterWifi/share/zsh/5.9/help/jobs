jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ]
jobs -Z string
       Lists  information  about  each given job, or all jobs if job is
       omitted.  The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p  flag  lists
       process  groups.   If the -r flag is specified only running jobs
       will be listed and if the -s flag is given only stopped jobs are
       shown.   If  the  -d flag is given, the directory from which the
       job was started (which may not be the current directory  of  the
       job) will also be shown.

       The  -Z  option  replaces  the  shell's argument and environment
       space with the given string,  truncated  if  necessary  to  fit.
       This will normally be visible in ps (ps(1)) listings.  This fea-
       ture is typically used by daemons, to indicate their state.

       Full job control is only available in the top-level  interactive
       shell, not in commands run in the left hand side of pipelines or
       within the (...) construct.  However,  a  snapshot  of  the  job
       state at that point is taken, so it is still possible to use the
       jobs builtin, or any parameter providing job information.   This
       gives  information about the state of jobs at the point the sub-
       shell was created.  If background processes are  created  within
       the  subshell, then instead information about those processes is
       provided.

       For example,

              sleep 10 &    # Job in background
              (             # Shell forks
              jobs          # Shows information about "sleep 10 &"
              sleep 5 &     # Process in background (no job control)
              jobs          # Shows information about "sleep 5 &"
              )
