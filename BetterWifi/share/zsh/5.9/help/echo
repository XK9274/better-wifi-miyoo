echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]
       Write each arg on the standard output, with a  space  separating
       each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a newline at the
       end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:

       \a     bell character
       \b     backspace
       \c     suppress subsequent characters and final newline
       \e     escape
       \f     form feed
       \n     linefeed (newline)
       \r     carriage return
       \t     horizontal tab
       \v     vertical tab
       \\     backslash
       \0NNN  character code in octal
       \xNN   character code in hexadecimal
       \uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal
       \UNNNNNNNN
              unicode character code in hexadecimal

       The -E flag, or the BSD_ECHO option,  can  be  used  to  disable
       these escape sequences.  In the latter case, -e flag can be used
       to enable them.

       Note that for standards compliance a double dash does not termi-
       nate  option  processing; instead, it is printed directly.  How-
       ever, a single dash does terminate  option  processing,  so  the
       first  dash, possibly following options, is not printed, but ev-
       erything following it is printed as  an  argument.   The  single
       dash  behaviour is different from other shells.  For a more por-
       table way of printing text, see printf, and for a more  control-
       lable way of printing text within zsh, see print.
