command [ -pvV ] simple command
       The  simple command argument is taken as an external command in-
       stead  of  a  function  or  builtin  and  is  executed.  If  the
       POSIX_BUILTINS option is set, builtins will also be executed but
       certain special properties of them are suppressed. The  -p  flag
       causes  a  default path to be searched instead of that in $path.
       With the -v flag, command is similar to whence and with  -V,  it
       is equivalent to whence -v.
