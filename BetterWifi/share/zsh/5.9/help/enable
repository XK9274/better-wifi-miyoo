enable [ -afmprs ] name ...
       Enable the named hash table elements, presumably  disabled  ear-
       lier  with  disable.  The default is to enable builtin commands.
       The -a option causes enable to act on regular or global aliases.
       The  -s  option  causes enable to act on suffix aliases.  The -f
       option causes enable to act on shell functions.  The  -r  option
       causes  enable  to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all
       enabled hash table elements from the  corresponding  hash  table
       are  printed.   With the -m flag the arguments are taken as pat-
       terns (should be quoted) and all hash table  elements  from  the
       corresponding  hash  table  matching these patterns are enabled.
       Enabled objects can be disabled with the  disable  builtin  com-
       mand.

       enable  -p  reenables  patterns  disabled with disable -p.  Note
       that it does not override globbing options; for example, `enable
       -p  "~"' does not cause the pattern character ~ to be active un-
       less the EXTENDED_GLOB option is also set.  To enable all possi-
       ble  patterns  (so  that  they may be individually disabled with
       disable -p), use `setopt EXTENDED_GLOB KSH_GLOB NO_SH_GLOB'.
