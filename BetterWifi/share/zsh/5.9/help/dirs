dirs [ -c ] [ arg ... ]
dirs [ -lpv ]
       With no arguments, print the contents of  the  directory  stack.
       Directories  are added to this stack with the pushd command, and
       removed with the cd or popd commands.  If arguments  are  speci-
       fied,  load  them  onto  the directory stack, replacing anything
       that was there, and push the current directory onto the stack.

       -c     clear the directory stack.

       -l     print directory names in full instead of using of using ~
              expressions  (see Dynamic and Static named directories in
              zshexpn(1)).

       -p     print directory entries one per line.

       -v     number the directories in the stack when printing.
