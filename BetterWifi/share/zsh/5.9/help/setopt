setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option_name ] [ -m ] [ name ... ]
       Set the options for the shell.   All  options  specified  either
       with flags or by name are set.

       If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently
       set are printed.  The form is chosen so as to minimize the  dif-
       ferences from the default options for the current emulation (the
       default emulation being native  zsh,  shown  as  <Z>  in  zshop-
       tions(1)).  Options that are on by default for the emulation are
       shown with the prefix no only if they are off, while  other  op-
       tions  are  shown without the prefix no and only if they are on.
       In addition to options changed from the  default  state  by  the
       user,  any options activated automatically by the shell (for ex-
       ample, SHIN_STDIN or INTERACTIVE) will be  shown  in  the  list.
       The  format  is further modified by the option KSH_OPTION_PRINT,
       however the rationale for choosing options with or  without  the
       no prefix remains the same in this case.

       If  the  -m  flag  is  given the arguments are taken as patterns
       (which should be quoted to protect  them  from  filename  expan-
       sion),  and  all  options with names matching these patterns are
       set.

       Note that a bad option name does not cause execution  of  subse-
       quent  shell  code to be aborted; this is behaviour is different
       from that of `set -o'.  This is because set  is  regarded  as  a
       special builtin by the POSIX standard, but setopt is not.
