# This is mainly a wrapper around the more general `_approximate'.
# By setting `compstate[pattern_match]' to something unequal to `*' and
# then calling `_approximate', we get only corrections, not all strings
# with the corrected prefix and something after it.
#
# Supported configuration keys are the same as for `_approximate', only
# starting with `correct'.
